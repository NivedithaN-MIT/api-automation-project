# api-automation-project
Objective:
Build a project in GitHub that involves developing, testing, and deploying a set of API calls with a fully automated CI/CD pipeline. Here's a breakdown of the use case:
1.	API Development:
Create code that interacts with 5 different APIs.
2.	Unit Testing:
Write unit tests for each API call to ensure that individual components behave as expected.
3.	Functional & Performance Testing:
Implement end-to-end functional tests to validate real API interactions and conduct performance tests to measure response times and load handling.
4.	CI/CD Integration:
Set up a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions to automate testing and deployment.
5.	Notification System:
Configure an email notification system within the CI/CD process to alert stakeholders whenever: 
o	Code changes are pushed or merged
o	The deployment is completed
